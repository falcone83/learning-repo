| Instruction | Description                                                                 | Operand(s)                       | Result                                                                                  |

| **add**     | Adds two operands and stores the result in the destination operand.          | `destination, source`           | `destination = destination + source`                                                      |
| **imul**    | Signed multiplication. Multiplies two operands (or one operand with a register), stores the result in a 64-bit register. | `destination, source` (or `source1, source2` for 2 operands) | `destination = destination * source` (signed multiplication). For 2 operands: `eax = source1 * source2` |
| **mul**     | Unsigned multiplication. Multiplies two operands (or one operand with the accumulator register), stores the result in a 64-bit register. | `source`                         | `eax = al * source` (for 8-bit values) or `edx:eax = eax * source` (for larger operands) |
| **sub**     | Subtracts the source operand from the destination operand.                    | `destination, source`           | `destination = destination - source`                                                      |
| **idiv**    | Signed integer division. Divides the 64-bit value formed by combining `eax` and `edx` by the operand. Stores the quotient in `eax` and the remainder in `edx`. | `source`                         | `eax = quotient, edx = remainder` (result of `eax:edx / source`)                        |
| **div**     | Unsigned integer division. Divides the 64-bit value formed by combining `eax` and `edx` by the operand. Stores the quotient in `eax` and the remainder in `edx`. | `source`                         | `eax = quotient, edx = remainder` (result of `eax:edx / source`)                        |
